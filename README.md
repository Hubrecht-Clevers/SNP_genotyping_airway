# SNP_genotyping_airway
 SNP_genotyping between airway bulk DNA and scRNA seq samples


The genomic locations and names of the SNPs can be found in the design.csv file.



The R-script allows to assign genotypes to different clusters found by SoupOrCell in the scRNA analysis.
For genotype assignment you need the following files:
 - design.csv
 - calibrator.csv
 - input_file.csv
 - scRNA-seq_genotype.vcf
